The most recent DNS attack vectors include DNS hijacking, DNS spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, DNS tunneling, and DNS amplification attacks.  As malicious attacks evolved to more sophisticated methods of exploitation, the fundamental issue remains; it's a wack-a-mole reality.  A mole problem requires fortification, detection, locating, and bringing the mole to face justice.

* `DNS hijacking` is a type of cyber attack that redirects a user from a legitimate website to a malicious one. It is done by malicious actors who are looking to steal information or spread malware. The targets of DNS hijacking are typically users who are unaware of the attack and are not using secure protocols to access the web. 

* `DNS spoofing`, also known as DNS cache poisoning, is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker corrupts a Domain Name System (DNS) serverâ€™s cache so that it resolves a domain name to the wrong IP address. This can allow the attacker to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate website to a malicious one, such as a phishing website that steals user credentials.
DNS spoofing attacks have been responsible for some major security breaches, such as the 2012 LinkedIn data breach that affected over 150 million users. In this case, attackers used a DNS spoofing attack to redirect users from the legitimate LinkedIn website to a fake one that asked them to enter their LinkedIn username and password.

* `DNS cache poisoning` is a cyber attack technique that involves corrupting the Domain Name System (DNS) cache of a server, allowing malicious actors to redirect users to malicious websites. Recent cases of DNS cache poisoning have made headlines, such as the attack on the City of Johannesburg's website in 2019, which resulted in the city's website being redirected to a phishing page, and the attack on the US Department of Defense in 2020, which resulted in malicious actors gaining access to sensitive information. 

* `DNS tunneling` is a technique used by attackers to bypass security policies and send malicious traffic through DNS servers. This technique has been used in a variety of attacks, including DDoS attacks, malware propagation, and data exfiltration. DNS tunneling can be difficult to detect, as it uses valid DNS requests and responses to encode and decode data. However, there are a few indicators that can be used to detect DNS tunneling activity, such as unusual DNS query types or high volumes of DNS queries. 

* `DNS amplification` attacks are often detected by looking at DNS server logs. These logs will show a large number of requests coming from a small number of sources. This is a tell-tale sign of an amplification attack. 


The all encompassing pattern indicators for these attacks are <sup><strong>unusual DNS query types, high volumnes of DNS queries from the same IP or group of IP addresses</strong></sup>.

## How to Verify DNSSEC Using Dig Command

The `DNSSEC` is an acronym for <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYuP6SreT-AhW4IDQIHYNMASgQFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icann.org%2Fresources%2Fpages%2Fdnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en&usg=AOvVaw33EyAgwgmXo-TledVfkt1m"><span style="color:blue">Domain Name System Security Extensions</span></a>.  
Using the network utility `dig`, we can verify the authentication of DNS data and DNS integrity. 

Requirements: Linux or WSL - Windows Linux Subsystem



<br />

1. **DNSSEC verification commands**: 

`dig +sigchase +trusted-key={key} `<span style="color:green">{YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME}</span> `A | grep -i validation`


_Successful sample_:


<span style="color:grey">markn@LAPTOP-G3V91M69:~$</span> `dig . DNSKEY | grep -Ev '^($|;)' > ./keys`

<span style="color:grey">markn@LAPTOP-G3V91M69:~$</span> `dig +sigchase +trusted-key=./keys www.ca.gov A | grep -i validation`

```javascript
;; WE HAVE MATERIAL, WE NOW DO VALIDATION
;; WE HAVE MATERIAL, WE NOW DO VALIDATION
;; WE HAVE MATERIAL, WE NOW DO VALIDATION
;; Ok this DNSKEY is a Trusted Key, DNSSEC validation is ok: SUCCESS
```

_Failure sample_:

<span style="color:grey">markn@LAPTOP-G3V91M69:~$</span> `dig +sigchase +trusted-key=./keys www.yahoo.com A | grep -i validation`

```javascript
;; RRSIG is missing for continue validation: FAILED
```


<br />

**Altenately, command `dig` used in combination with `+dnssec` option**

<span style="color:grey">markn@LAPTOP-G3V91M69:~$</span> `dig www.ca.gov +dnssec +multi`
